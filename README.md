## Software Requirements

| Requirement       | Type          | Role                                  |
|:------------------|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------|
| bump2version      | Python CLI    | automatic version increment           |
| Doxygen           | application   | source code documentation             |
| GFortran          | application   | Fortran 2018 compiler                 |
| Just              | Rust binary   | execution of the build instructions   |

| Scriv             | Python CLI    | changelog management                  |
| TeX Live (full)   | package       | LaTeX environment for Doxygen manual  |

This library is written in Fortran 2018 such that its build requires a compiler
supporting this standard.  This project relies on **GFortran** therefore.

The library build is organised with **Just**.  The corresponding `.justfile`
does not only take care for the compilation of the library but also for its
documentation and testing.

The documentation is generated by **Doxygen**.  The configured output formats
are listed in the following.

* HTML
* LaTeX
* UNIX manual pages

In order to finalise the LaTeX documentation, an appropriate LaTeX distribution
is required.  A *full* installation of **TeX Live** is recommended.  This
project employs **Latexmk** as LaTeX build manager for the manual finalisation.

In order to simplify the maintenance, **bump2version** as well as **Scriv** are
used to automate the release generation.  Scriv will compile the changelog on
release after all version numbers were incremented by bump2version.
